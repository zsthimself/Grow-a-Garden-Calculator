            <h2>What Are Mutations and Why Are They Important?</h2>
            <p>In Grow a Garden, Mutations are special traits that can randomly appear on your crops when you harvest them. They are the single most important factor for maximizing your profit, or 'Sheckles'. A common crop with a rare combination of mutations can be worth thousands of times more than a normal one. Understanding how to acquire these mutations is the key to moving from a casual gardener to a wealthy tycoon. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of every known mutation, its sell-price multiplier, and the precise methods required to obtain it. Use this knowledge, combined with our powerful <a href="/">profit calculator</a>, to strategically plan your farming operations.</p>

            <h3>Weather & Time-Based Mutations</h3>
            <p>These are some of the most common mutations players will encounter. They are entirely dependent on the in-game weather cycle and time of day. To farm these effectively, you must be observant and ready to harvest your fields the moment the right conditions appear.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Wet (x1.2)</dt>
                <dd>This is a foundational weather mutation. To acquire it, you must harvest any of your fully grown crops while it is actively raining in the game. The chance is not 100%, so it's best to have a large field ready to harvest to maximize your opportunities during a single downpour.</dd>
                
                <dt>Drenched (x5)</dt>
                <dd>A much more valuable version of the Wet mutation. To get a Drenched crop, you must harvest during the more intense weather event of a thunderstorm. Thunderstorms are rarer than simple rain and are accompanied by lightning and thunder sounds. Having crops ready for this event can lead to significant profit boosts.</dd>
                
                <dt>Chilled (x2)</dt>
                <dd>This mutation is tied to the in-game seasons. You can only obtain the Chilled mutation by harvesting crops during the Winter season. Pay attention to the environment turning snowy and frosty, and use this period to farm for this specific trait.</dd>

                <dt>Moonlit (x2)</dt>
                <dd>One of the easiest mutations to acquire. Simply harvest any crop during the night cycle in the game. The sky will be dark, and stars will be visible. Because the day-night cycle is constant, you can reliably plan your harvests to farm for this mutation.</dd>
            </dl>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h3>Item & Ability-Based Mutations</h3>
            <p>These mutations are not random; they are directly caused by using specific in-game items or star abilities on your crops before harvesting. This gives you more control over the outcome, but often requires energy or resources.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Gilded (x1.5) & Gold (x20)</dt>
                <dd>Both of these valuable mutations are obtained by using the "Midas Touch" star ability on your crops. When you activate this ability, it affects a patch of crops. Upon harvesting, these crops have a chance to become Gilded for a small boost, or a much rarer chance to become Gold for a massive x20 multiplier. To farm these, focus on using Midas Touch on your highest base-value plants.</dd>
                
                <dt>Radioactive (x80)</dt>
                <dd>One of the most powerful mutations for high-end farming. To get it, you must plant and harvest crops inside the hazardous Nuclear Wasteland area. Accessing this biome may require game progression. The high risk and effort are rewarded with one of the best multipliers available, making it a key part of any late-game money-making strategy.</dd>
                
                <dt>Zombified (x5)</dt>
                <dd>This unique mutation requires interaction with an NPC. In the Graveyard biome, you must lure the "Undead Stalker" (zombie) to walk over your planted crops. This 'infection' gives them a chance to be Zombified upon harvest. It's a slightly risky but fun way to get a solid multiplier.</dd>

                <dt>Cooked (x10) & Burnt (x4)</dt>
                <dd>These are the result of using the "Heat" star ability on your plants. Using this ability has a high chance of making your crops Cooked for a great x10 multiplier, but it also has a chance of giving the less-valuable Burnt mutation. It's a game of chance, but often worth the risk.</dd>

            <h3>General Strategies for Mutation Farming</h3>
            <p>Beyond knowing the specific sources, applying certain strategies can dramatically increase your efficiency.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plant in Grids:</strong> Arrange your crops in dense square grids. This maximizes the area of effect for abilities like Midas Touch or Heat, allowing you to affect more plants with a single ability use.</li>
                <li><strong>Patience is Key:</strong> Don't harvest your crops immediately when they mature if you are waiting for a specific condition. It's better to let a field of high-value crops sit ready and wait for a thunderstorm than to harvest them for a normal price.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine Mutations:</strong> The true path to wealth is through "stacking" multiple mutations on a single plant. A crop that is both Drenched (from a thunderstorm) and Gold (from Midas Touch) will have its value multiplied by both, leading to exponential profit growth. Always try to layer effects when possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Use the Right Tool:</strong> Once you get a crop with multiple mutations, don't just guess its value! Use our <a href="/">calculator</a> by selecting the crop and ticking all the checkboxes for its mutations to see its true, incredible worth before you sell.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>What are the best mutations for beginners?</dt>
                <dd>For new players, focusing on time and weather-based mutations is easiest. Aim for 'Moonlit' and 'Wet' as they occur frequently and provide a nice starting boost without requiring special items or area access.</dd>
                <dt>What is the single most valuable mutation?</dt>
                <dd>Based on its multiplier, 'Dawnbound (x150)' and 'Voidtouched (x135)' are among the highest. However, their rarity and the difficulty in obtaining them mean that more common but powerful mutations like 'Radioactive (x80)' or 'Shocked (x100)' often form the backbone of a player's income.</dd>
                <dt>Can I have more than one of a single mutation on a crop?</dt>
                <dd>No, a crop can only have one of each type of mutation. For example, a plant cannot be both 'Wet' and 'Drenched'. It can, however, be 'Wet' and 'Gilded' simultaneously.</dd>
