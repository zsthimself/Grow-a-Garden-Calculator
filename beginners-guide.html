            <h2>Step 1: Your First Harvests</h2>
            <p>Welcome to your garden! Your initial goal is simple: plant, harvest, sell, and repeat. Don't worry about fancy mutations or pets just yet. Your first task is to build a small capital base. Start by planting the cheapest seeds available, like <strong>Carrots</strong> and <strong>Strawberries</strong>. Your guiding principle should be "Profit Per Minute". A crop that grows fast, even if it sells for less, will often make you more money over time than a slow-growing one. Use our <a href="/">profit calculator</a> to compare early-game crops and see this for yourself!</p>
            <p>Your early-game progression should look like this: plant cheap crops until you can afford a full field of a more profitable mid-tier crop like <strong>Pineapples</strong> or <strong>Pumpkins</strong>. Fill every available plot of land to maximize each harvest cycle.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Understanding Boosts - Your First Pet</h2>
            <p>Once you have a steady income, it's time to think about your first major investment: a pet. Pets provide permanent percentage-based boosts to your income and are essential for growth. Don't spend your early Sheckles on expensive seeds yet; save up for a <strong>Common Pet Egg</strong>. Even a basic +5% or +10% boost from a common pet will dramatically speed up your earnings.</p>
            <p>You will also start to see strange-looking crops in your harvest. These have **mutations**. A mutated crop can be worth many times its normal value. Never sell a mutated crop without first checking its value in our calculator!

            <h3>Step 3: Essential Tips for Fast Growth</h3>
            <p>Follow these core principles to stay ahead of the curve:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Always Be Planting:</strong> Never let your farm plots sit empty. As soon as you harvest, immediately replant. An idle plot is lost profit.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow the Questline:</strong> The game has a quest system that guides you and rewards you with valuable items and Sheckles. Completing quests is the fastest way to unlock new, more profitable areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Leverage Other Players' Abilities:</strong> Keep an eye out for other players using "Star Abilities" like Midas Touch (creates golden crops) or Heat Wave. If you see these abilities being used, harvest your crops while they are affected to gain massive bonuses.</li>
                <li><strong>Server Time & Weather Matter:</strong> Remember that harvesting at night gives a 'Moonlit' bonus, and harvesting in the rain gives a 'Wet' bonus. These small, free boosts add up over time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Long-Term Goal</h2>
            <p>Your primary objective as a new player is to earn enough money to unlock the next biome (like the Desert or Tundra). Each new biome offers seeds with a significantly higher base profit, making all of your boosts and mutations even more effective. Keep farming, follow the quests, invest in pets, and you'll be a millionaire in no time!</p>
